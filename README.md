â€“ Multi 7-Segment Clock Project
Description

A challenging embedded systems project from my journey at ITI. This project demonstrates driving 6 seven-segment displays using a microcontroller that supports only 4, showing seconds and minutes in real-time.

Features

Full clock functionality with seconds and minutes.

Multiplexing technique to control more displays than the microcontroller natively supports.

Clean and modular C code for AVR microcontrollers.

Hardware

Microcontroller: AVR (e.g., ATmega32)

6 Common Cathode Seven-Segment Displays

Resistors for current limiting

Breadboard & wires

Usage

Connect the 6 seven-segment displays as per the pin mapping in the code.

Load the project on your AVR microcontroller.

Watch the clock count seconds and minutes accurately.
